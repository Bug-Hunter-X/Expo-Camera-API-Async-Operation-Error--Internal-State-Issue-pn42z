# Expo Camera API Async Operation Error

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API related to asynchronous operations and internal state management. The issue occurs when using a custom camera component and involves an asynchronous operation that isn't properly handled, leading to an unclear error message and unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests as an error within the Expo Camera API when attempting certain operations with a custom camera component.  The error message is not specific and points only to a problem with the internal state. This is because an asynchronous action within the component is not appropriately synchronized with the camera's state lifecycle, resulting in inconsistencies.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Attempt to interact with the camera (e.g., take a picture). You should encounter the described error.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully managing the asynchronous operations within the camera component to ensure that the component's state remains synchronized with the camera's state lifecycle.  This typically involves using promises, async/await, or other suitable techniques for managing asynchronous code.  The correct synchronization strategy will depend on the specific details of the component's implementation.
