This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component. The error message is not very descriptive and only indicates a problem with the camera's internal state.  The issue arises because of an asynchronous operation within the camera component that isn't properly handled, leading to unexpected state changes. This can happen if you try to access or modify the camera state before it's fully initialized or after it's been unmounted.
